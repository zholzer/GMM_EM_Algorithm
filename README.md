# GMM_EM_Algorithm
Parallel implementation of the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for the Gaussian Mixture Model in C

Taught by Professor Miguel Dumett for COMP 605 at SDSU
Implemented by Christine Cho and Zoe Holzer

In this project, we parallelize the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models in C using OpenMP and MPI. We use similar implementations and then compare the timing of the two with simulated datasets with varying array lengths, shapes, and levels of noise.

In holzer/EMAlgorithm, everything is pre-compiled and executed. To replicate, do the following:

To compile OpenMP:

gcc -g  gmm_em_openmp.c gmm_em_functions.c -o bin/gmm_em_openmp -fopenmp  -Wall -lm

To compile MPI:

mpicc -g gmm_em_mpi.c gmm_em_functions.c -o bin/gmm_em_mpi -Wall -lm

To run the script:

qsub batch.em

It will take ~40 walltime in the queue.

The labels will be in labels.txt and the output of the batch script will be in out.txt.
